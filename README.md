# Data Structures in C
Using C, I wanted to implement data structures in more efficient ways, not only as practice but to save time from having to reinvent the wheel each time in the future applications I write. 

This will allow me to improve my knowledge for when I begin doing embedded systems, operating systems, and compiler work in my free time in the distant future.
